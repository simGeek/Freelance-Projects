1) Web Scraping Freelance Project (Client Deliverable in JSON Format)

Scraped data from a structured website with 10 top-level categories (direct links). Each category contained hundreds to thousands of sub-links (ranging from ~100 to ~7000). The scraping was performed at three nested levels, ensuring thorough data collection.

The client required the data in a specific JSON format, where:

Each top-level category is a dictionary.

Each sub-category is represented as key-value pairs.

Values included a mix of strings, nested dictionaries, and lists of dictionaries.

To ensure accuracy, each category was shared separately for validation before compiling the complete JSON with all 10 categories for final delivery.
