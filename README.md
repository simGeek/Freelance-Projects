1) Webscraping Project

The client was in a need of a JSON file of 10 categories. Each category(a dictionary) had a list of multiple sub categories(dictionaries). Each sub category is a key value pair where some values are strings, others are dictionaries and still others are list of multiple dictionaries. 

Each category was sent separately first to ensure its correctness and the full scraped file with all the 10 categories was sent at the end as the final deliverable.
